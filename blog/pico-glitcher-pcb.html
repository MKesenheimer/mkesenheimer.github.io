                                            Voltage glitching attacks are usually done with expensive hardware such as the ChipWhisperer Pro or Husky.
                                            However, for most of the attacks a Raspberry Pi Pico and a few other components are required.
                                            In order to achieve the best results, a circuit board was developed to combine the best of both worlds: cheap, easy to use and powerful.

                                            Voltage glitching attacks are a class of hardware attacks that exploit the vulnerability of electronic systems to sudden and brief changes in their power supply voltage.
                                            By intentionally introducing these abrupt voltage changes, or "glitches," attackers aim to disrupt the normal operation of the target device, causing it to malfunction in a controlled manner.
                                            This can result in the bypassing of security measures, corruption of data, or unintended execution of code. Voltage glitching is particularly relevant in the context of embedded systems, such as microcontrollers and smart cards, which are commonly used in secure applications including payment systems, access controls, and IoT devices.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The core concept behind voltage glitching is to induce faults at precise moments during the execution of critical operations within the device.
                                            These faults can lead to outcomes such as skipping security checks, extracting secret keys, or gaining unauthorized access to protected functions.
                                            The success of a voltage glitching attack relies on careful timing and an understanding of the target device's behavior under different power conditions.
                                            Attackers often use specialized equipment to generate and control these glitches with high precision, making this technique both sophisticated and powerful.

                                            As these devices are typically very expensive (several hundred Euros), they are not accessible for the hobby hacker. The ChipWhisperer Husky is even more inaccessible for hobby hackers since it has long shipping times up to several weeks.

                                            It turns out, however, that voltage glitching attacks can easily be performed with cheap and available hardware like the Rapberry Pi Pico and some other components.
                                            The sampling rate of the Raspberry Pi Pico is fast enough to enable attacks against most common microcontrollers like the ESP32 or STM32 processors.
                                            To gain more insight into voltage glitching attacks and using only cheap components, the PicoGlitcher was born.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The hardware required for the PicoGlitcher involves, of course, a Raspberry Pi Pico and additional components for precise voltage control and monitoring.
                                            Specifically, it includes a power supply capable of switching the target on and off, and crowbar transistors that can switch up to 66 amps.
                                            The design of the voltage glitching stage of the PicoGlitcher is exactly the same as found in the ChipWhisperer Pro.
                                            Furthermore, the board provides several different voltages to supply all kinds of different target boards.
                                            A built-in level shifter translates between the fixed voltages of the Raspberry Pi Pico and the voltage levels of the target board.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Glitches must be placed very precisely.
                                            The PicoGlitcher is able to trigger on various external events.
                                            For example, a rising or falling edge could be used to start the timers.
                                            Additionally, the PicoGlitcher can sniff on a UART communication and trigger if a specific word is sent.

                                            The fault-injection-library also supports the ChipWhisperer hardware (Pro and Husky).
                                            So if you have access to these tools, you can use this library to perform fault injection attacks.

                                        <p>After ten days I received my order from <a href="http://jlcpcb.com">JLCBCP</a>. As mentioned in the previous project log, generating the design files (gerber, CPL and BOM) was fairly straight forward.</p>

                                        <p>The finished PCBs are of high quality. I could not find any errors and the components are perfectly placed and soldered. I am really happy with the way the PicoGlitcher PCB turned out.</p>

                                        <div class="paddingTop0 paddingBottom30 kesenheimer-image">
                                            <figure>

                                        </div>

                                        <p>The next step was to solder the rest of the components onto the board. For example, the Raspberry Pi Pico and some other through-hole components have to be soldered by hand. The finished board can be seen below.</p>

                                        <div class="paddingTop0 paddingBottom30 kesenheimer-image">

                                        </div>

                                        <p>The new design also works flawlessly. I could generate reproducible glitches on a STM microcontroller within a few minutes.</p>
